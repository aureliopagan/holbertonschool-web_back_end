# 📄 Pagination Tasks

Welcome to the pagination learning module! This directory contains hands-on tasks to master different pagination techniques used in modern APIs and web applications.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

**Task 0:** 🔧 **Simple Helper Function**  
Build the foundational utility functions you'll need for pagination logic.

**Task 1:** 📊 **Basic Pagination**  
Implement straightforward pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters - the bread and butter of most APIs.

**Task 2:** 🔗 **Hypermedia Pagination**  
Level up with hypermedia-driven pagination that includes rich metadata and navigation links.

**Task 3:** 🛡️ **Deletion-Resilient Hypermedia Pagination**  
Master advanced pagination that gracefully handles real-world scenarios where data gets deleted between requests.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing these tasks, you'll understand:

- ✅ **Basic Pagination Patterns** - How to slice and dice datasets with simple page/size parameters
- ✅ **Hypermedia Design** - Building self-documenting APIs with embedded navigation metadata  
- ✅ **Resilient Architecture** - Creating pagination that doesn't break when underlying data changes
- ✅ **Real-World Application** - Handling edge cases and user experience considerations

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Work through the tasks in order - each one builds on the concepts from the previous. Happy paginating!
