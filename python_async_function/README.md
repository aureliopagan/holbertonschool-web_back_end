Python - Async 🐍⚡
Welcome to the Python - Async project! 🚀 This project will introduce you to the world of asynchronous programming in Python, focusing on the async and await syntax, asyncio, and running concurrent coroutines. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

📚 Resources
Before you start, make sure to check out these resources:

Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough 📄
asyncio - Asynchronous I/O 📜
random.uniform 🎲
🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without Googling:

async and await syntax 🐍
How to execute an async program with asyncio ⚡
How to run concurrent coroutines 🏃‍♂️
How to create asyncio tasks 🛠️
How to use the random module 🎲
📋 Requirements
General
README: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory 📖
Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs 🖥️
Python Version: All files will be interpreted/compiled using Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 🐍
File Format:
All files must end with a new line 📄
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3 🐍
Executable Files: All your files must be executable 🏃‍♂️
Code Style: Your code should follow the pycodestyle (version 2.5.x) guidelines 🧹
Type Annotations: All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated 📝
Documentation:
Modules: Each module should have a documentation string (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)') 📄
Functions: Each function should have a documentation string (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)') 📝
Note: Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. The length of the documentation will be verified. 📏
🛠️ Tools & Libraries
asyncio: Python’s built-in library for writing asynchronous code.
random: Python’s built-in library for generating random numbers.
