Python - Async Comprehension 🐍⚡
Welcome to the Python - Async Comprehension project! 🚀
This directory focuses on asynchronous generators, async comprehensions, and parallel comprehensions.
You’ll learn how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators. Let’s dive in! 🏊‍♂️  

📋 Tasks
This directory contains the following tasks:  

Async Generator 🌀
Async Comprehensions 🔄
Run Time for Four Parallel Comprehensions ⏱️
🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:  

Write an asynchronous generator 🌀
Use async comprehensions 🔄
Type-annotate generators 📝
Measure the runtime of parallel comprehensions ⏱️
🛠️ Tools & Libraries
asyncio: Python’s built-in library for asynchronous programming.
random: Python’s built-in library for generating random numbers.
